This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  The issue arises from directly parsing a route parameter as an integer without prior validation, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected results if the parameter is not a valid number. The solution involves adding checks to ensure the parameter is valid before attempting the conversion and handling potential errors gracefully.
